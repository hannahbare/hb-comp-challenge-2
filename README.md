# hb-comp-challenge-2

This is the second static comp challenge out of a series of three focus on HTML/CSS. I was asked to recreate a static comp, with each growing in complexity. For each challenge, I was given a static comp and asked to recreate it. The objective is to build something that respects the integrity of the original design.
